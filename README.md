## **üéØ Objective**
The objective of **UNITYPATH** is to create a seamless volunteer matching platform that:
- Bridges the gap between organizations in need of volunteers and individuals who want to contribute.
- Enables efficient management of opportunities and volunteers.
- Promotes social change by supporting humanitarian, environmental, and community-building initiatives.

## **üì¶ Core Classes**
- **`Volunteer`:** This class represents a volunteer with attributes like `id`, `name`, `password`, and `skills`. It extends the abstract class `User` and provides the `viewOpportunities()` method for displaying available opportunities.
- **`Organization`:** Represents an organization that can post volunteer opportunities. Includes methods for managing organizations and interacting with the volunteer database.
- **`Opportunity`:** Represents a volunteer opportunity with fields like `title`, `requiredSkills`, `location`, and dates. This class manages the details of each opportunity.
- **`User (Abstract)`:** This base class holds common attributes like `id`, `name`, and `email` for both volunteers and organizations. It defines the abstract method `viewOpportunities()` to be implemented by subclasses.
- **`TestConnection`:** A utility class used to test the connection to a MySQL database, ensuring the system can interact with a database properly.
- **`DesignUtils`:** A utility class for formatting output, clearing the screen, and printing styled headers and messages, helping improve user interaction.

## **üßë‚Äçüíª Core Principles of OOP**
The system follows key **Object-Oriented Programming** principles, such as:

1. **Encapsulation:** 
   - Each class has its own attributes and methods, ensuring the internal workings of each object are hidden and only relevant data is exposed.
   - Example: The `Volunteer` class encapsulates details like `name` and `skills`, while the `Opportunity` class encapsulates opportunity-specific details.

2. **Inheritance:**
   - The `User` class is an abstract base class that defines common properties like `id`, `name`, and `email`. Both `Volunteer` and `Organization` classes inherit from `User`, making the system extensible for future types of users.

3. **Polymorphism:**
   - The abstract method `viewOpportunities()` in the `User` class allows different subclasses (e.g., `Volunteer`, `Organization`) to provide their specific implementations of how opportunities are viewed.

4. **Abstraction:**
   - Complex logic, such as database connections or console clearing, is abstracted into utility methods like those in the `DesignUtils` and `TestConnection` classes, simplifying the user-facing functionality.

## **üåç SDG Alignment**
**UNITYPATH** aligns with the following **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):**

- **SDG 10: Reduced Inequality**  
   By connecting volunteers to community organizations, the platform helps in reducing inequality by fostering inclusion and support for marginalized groups.

- **SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals**  
   The platform serves as a catalyst for partnerships by linking volunteers to organizations, fostering cooperation to achieve common goals.

## **About the Devoloper**
 Hey there! I‚Äôm Ken Patrick Joshua N. Gaa, the sole developer behind UNITYPATH. UNITYPATH was created as part of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) final project, where I was tasked with building a console application that follows OOP principles and aligns with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This project has been both a rewarding and challenging experience, as it not only helped me with my academic goals but also has the potential to make a positive impact on the community.

I designed UNITYPATH to facilitate volunteer matching, making it easier for individuals to connect with organizations in need of help. Although the system currently contains the basic features I envisioned, I‚Äôm excited about continuing to develop and expand it. Reaching this point in the project reflects my commitment to seeing it through to completion.

Developing UNITYPATH has taught me many valuable lessons, from managing databases to working through complex logic. Every step has been a learning experience, and at times, it has tested my patience. But through it all, it has helped me refine my skills and think critically about creating a platform that truly serves its users.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my project! This is more than just an academic requirement‚Äîit represents a step forward in my journey as a developer, and I look forward to building upon it. I‚Äôm excited to see where my growth in software development and community service will take me in the future.

Best regards,
Ken Patrick Joshua N. Gaa
