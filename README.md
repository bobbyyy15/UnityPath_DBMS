- **Organization:** Represents an organization that can post volunteer opportunities. Includes methods for managing organizations and interacting with the volunteer database.
- **Opportunity:** Represents a volunteer opportunity with fields like title, requiredSkills, location, and dates. This class manages the details of each opportunity.
- **User (Abstract):** This base class holds common attributes like id, name, and email for both volunteers and organizations. It defines the abstract method viewOpportunities() to be implemented by subclasses.

## **üí° Database Schema & Relationships**
### **Schema Overview:**

- **Volunteers Table:** 
   - Columns: `id`, `name`, `password`, `skills`
   - Stores volunteer details like id, name, password, and skills.

- **Organizations Table:** 
   - Columns: `id`, `name`, `password`
   - Stores organization details like id, name, and password.

- **Opportunities Table:** 
   - Columns: `id`, `title`, `requiredSkills`, `location`, `dates`, `postedBy (foreign key to Organizations)`
   - Contains volunteer opportunity information and links to the `Organizations` table.

- **Applications Table:** 
   - Columns: `id`, `volunteerId (foreign key to Volunteers)`, `opportunityId (foreign key to Opportunities)`, `status`
   - Tracks the status of volunteer applications to opportunities, linking `Volunteers` and `Opportunities`.

### **Relationships:**
- **One-to-Many:** 
   - One organization can post multiple opportunities, forming a one-to-many relationship between the `Organizations` and `Opportunities` tables.
   
- **Many-to-Many:** 
   - Volunteers can apply for multiple opportunities, and each opportunity can have multiple applicants. This is managed via the `Applications` table, which serves as a junction table.

## **About the Devoloper**
 Hey there! I‚Äôm Ken Patrick Joshua N. Gaa, the sole developer behind UNITYPATH. Although the system currently contains the basic features I envisioned, I‚Äôm excited about continuing to develop and expand it. Reaching this point in the project reflects my commitment to seeing it through to completion.

Developing UNITYPATH has taught me many valuable lessons, from managing databases to working through complex logic. Every step has been a learning experience, and at times, it has tested my patience. But through it all, it has helped me refine my skills and think critically about creating a platform that truly serves its users.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my project! This is more than just an academic requirement‚Äîit represents a step forward in my journey as a developer, and I look forward to building upon it. I‚Äôm excited to see where my growth in software development and community service will take me in the future.

Best regards,
Ken Patrick Joshua N. Gaa
